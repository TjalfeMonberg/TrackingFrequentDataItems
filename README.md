# TrackingFrequentDataItems
This is a repo for a Bachelor Project at Aarhus University by Tjalfe Monberg and Ruben Mortensen

# Description of the project
This project will investigate the art of tracking frequently seen items in arbitrary data streams, and doing so in limited memory space, so as to be more efficient when scaled to big data companies such as Google

The project aims to evaluate the performance of mainly two algorithms, that achieve this goal, Count Sketch and Count-Min Sketch, with reflections on how these may differ from other potentially popular choices. The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive comparison of these algorithms and determine the most optimal solution for tracking frequent items in data streams, depending on scale.

The project will analyze the accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms by processing real-world data streams and comparing their results. The results will be analyzed in terms of the algorithms' ability to track the most frequent items and their accuracy in estimating the frequency of these items. The project will also consider the memory overhead and query time of each algorithm, as these are important factors in real-world applications.

The findings of this project will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and will help practitioners choose the best solution for their specific needs. Furthermore, the project will contribute to the understanding of how these algorithms are used in the context of tracking frequent items in data streams and the trade-offs involved with each.

# Algorithms in use
This project will use and investigate, analyse and use the following algortihms:
- Misra-Gries
- Count-Sketch
- Count-Min-Sketch (With and without the heavy hitters implementation)
